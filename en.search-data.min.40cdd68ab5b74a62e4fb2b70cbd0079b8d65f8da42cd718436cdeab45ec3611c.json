I feel like this can be more flexible in some cases where the GUI may not allow for precise customizations.\nMy directory for this summer project looks like this. I created a test directory called playground within programmatic:\n└── psychopy ├── demos ├── graphical └── programmatic └── playground \nIt\u0026rsquo;s a fairly large package and is constantly updated, so installing it globally would not be the best idea; I can change directory into the playground directory, create a virtualenv to install psychopy using pip. This way, the entire psychopy package can be used isolated within that folder only.\ncd psychopy/programmatic virtualenv venv # creates a virtual environment using python 3.9 pip install psychopy # installs psychopy and all its dependencies touch main.py # create main.py file # it should now look like this. └── psychopy ├── demos ├── graphical └── programmatic └── playground ├── venv │\t└── \u0026#34;psychopy source\u0026#34; └── main.py Sample code #  I took the sample code from their \u0026ldquo;scripting only\u0026rdquo; docs and put it into main.py using any text editor:\nfrom psychopy import visual, core # import some libraries from PsychoPy #create a window mywin = visual.Window([800,600], monitor=\u0026#34;testMonitor\u0026#34;, units=\u0026#34;deg\u0026#34;) #create some stimuli grating = visual.GratingStim(win=mywin, mask=\u0026#34;circle\u0026#34;, size=3, pos=[-4,0], sf=3) fixation = visual.GratingStim(win=mywin, size=0.5, pos=[0,0], sf=0, rgb=-1) #draw the stimuli and update the window grating.draw() fixation.draw() mywin.update() #pause, so you get a chance to see it! core.wait(10.0) \nAfter pressing cmd+B to compile it, we should expect to see a window pop up with multiple stimuli and it should close after 10 seconds:\n\nNow that we have everything set up, we should proceed the actual demos and take note of any difficulties and/or successes. The visual search task would be a good start.\nOpen source packages #  I decided to write these logs in markdown as a form of documentation so it can be easy to view updates. I\u0026rsquo;m using Hugo static site generator with a book theme because it is clean and easy to setup for documentation purposes.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/psychopy-notes/docs/setup/windows-setup/","title":"Windows Setup","section":"Setup","content":"Windows Specifications #  The background of my hardware specifications with the version of Python and PsychoPy I am using are shown below:\nEdition: Windows 10 Pro Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2100 CPU @ 3.10GHz 3.10GHz Installed RAM: 4.00 GB System Type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor OS Build: 19041.1052 Python: Python 3.9 64-bit PsychoPy: v2021.2.0 Method 1. Install Standalone executable #  The first way to install PsychoPy is by using .exe file. Navigate to their github repository and find StandalonePsychoPy-2021.2.0.1-win64.exe\nOpen the PsychoPy app in your applications and it should open the PsychoPy builder.\nMethod 2. Install Python and Pip #  The second way to utilize psychopy is via the pip package. First check if pip is installed on your computer. You can do this using:\npip --version If it isn\u0026rsquo;t installed, you should go to python.org and select the latest installer for python 3.9. My windows installation came with python 3.6.6 but not pip, so this might be the case for you. The site will auto-detect the OS of your machine so just select download. At the time of this post, the latest is Python 3.9.6. The installer will be an exe.\nWhen you first run it, make sure to check Add Python 3.9 to PATH. This will add py to your environment variables so you can use the latest version of python in the command prompt.\n2.1 Run in command prompt #  Once the setup is complete, you can ensure the latest version of python is running by typing python, pip --version or pip helpin a new instance of your command prompt:\nIf running python still gives you the pre-installed version of python (3.6.6 in this case), you can try running py. It should now show 3.9.6.\n2.2 pip install PsychoPy #  Now that you have the latest version of python and pip on your computer, you can install psychopy using pip.\n Install PsychoPy via pip through cmd by typing pip install psychopy  This will install psychopy as a global package. After running pip list, you will see wheel, setuptools, and psychopy (and psychopy\u0026rsquo;s dependencies) listed out.   Create your designated project folder.  Navigate to that folder, right-click \u0026gt; new \u0026gt; folder   While in the command prompt, use cd to change directory to the folder you created.  When you first open command prompt, you will be in your root directory.  If you created the folder in your Desktop, then type: cd Desktop/{Folder Name} Run ECHO \u0026gt;\u0026gt; main.py, which will create an empty python file called \u0026lsquo;main.py\u0026rsquo;.      Open main.py using any text editor of your choosing. Insert this code snippet (from the official docs) like we did in the macOS setup.  from psychopy import visual, core, event #import some libraries from PsychoPy #create a window mywin = visual.Window([800,600],monitor=\u0026#34;testMonitor\u0026#34;, units=\u0026#34;deg\u0026#34;) #create some stimuli grating = visual.GratingStim(win=mywin, mask=\u0026#39;circle\u0026#39;, size=3, pos=[-4,0], sf=3) fixation = visual.GratingStim(win=mywin, size=0.2, pos=[0,0], sf=0, rgb=-1) #draw the stimuli and update the window while True: #this creates a never-ending loop grating.setPhase(0.05, \u0026#39;+\u0026#39;)#advance phase by 0.05 of a cycle grating.draw() fixation.draw() mywin.flip() if len(event.getKeys())\u0026gt;0: break event.clearEvents() #cleanup mywin.close() core.quit() While you\u0026rsquo;re still in the Project directory that you made earlier, you should type in python main.py in the command prompt. It should output a window with some test stimuli. Congrats, it now runs on windows!\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/psychopy-notes/menu/","title":"Index","section":"Introduction","content":" Setup  Mac Windows     "}]
